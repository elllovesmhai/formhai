        <h1>To My Love, Mhai</h1>
        <p>Hi, my love, my Mhai, my baby,</p>
        <p>
            I don’t even know where to begin because words feel so small compared to the love I feel for you. 
            But I’ll do my best to let you know how much you mean to me, how deeply I care for you, and how grateful I am to have you in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the moment you came into my life, everything changed. It was like the world gained new colors, and every day started to feel brighter, fuller, and more meaningful. 
            You have this incredible way of making even the simplest moments feel special. Whether it’s a laugh we share over something silly, a quiet moment when we’re just sitting together, or a deep conversation about life and dreams—everything feels better with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mhai, you are so much more than my girlfriend. You’re my best friend, my partner, my confidant, and my greatest source of happiness. 
            There’s no one else I can imagine sharing my life with. You make me feel understood in a way no one else ever has. 
            With you, I can be completely myself—no walls, no pretending—just me. And that’s one of the most beautiful gifts you’ve given me.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I look at you, I see someone so incredible, so full of love and kindness. You’re beautiful in every possible way—inside and out. 
            Your smile can light up my darkest days, and your laughter is my favorite sound in the world. I could spend a lifetime just listening to you talk, watching you smile, and being by your side.
        </p>
        <p>
            What amazes me most about you, baby, is your heart. You’re so thoughtful, so selfless, and so full of love for the people around you. 
            It inspires me every day. I often find myself wondering how I got so lucky to have you. 
            What did I ever do to deserve someone as amazing as you? I still don’t know, but I thank God every day for bringing you into my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Love, you make me want to be a better person. You inspire me to grow, to learn, and to strive for more—not just for myself, but for us. 
            I want to give you the life you deserve, filled with happiness, security, and love. I want to be your rock, your safe place, your biggest supporter, and your greatest cheerleader.
        </p>
        <p>
            Baby, I love you in ways I can’t fully explain. It’s in the way I think about you constantly, even when we’re apart. 
            It’s in the way my heart feels lighter when I see your name on my phone or hear your voice. 
            It’s in the way I imagine our future together and feel nothing but excitement and hope.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you, baby, for being you. Thank you for loving me, for believing in me, and for standing by me. 
            Thank you for all the little things you do that make me smile, for all the ways you make me feel loved, and for all the ways you make my life better.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love you so much, Mhai. I love you more than words can ever express. I love you more than I thought it was possible to love someone. 
            And I promise to keep loving you, every day, for the rest of my life. I’m sorry, baby, if I upset you sometimes. Please know that I love you forever. I promise, baby, I love you so much.
        </p>
